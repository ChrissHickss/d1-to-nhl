# d1-to-nhl
This is a project inspired by Patrick Bacon's TopDownHockey Scraper project. I used his TDH Scraper package to predict NHL success based off NCAA success. 

Some tips to make sure your file runs correctly when you clone this down:

* First create a virtual environment. (I like to do 'python -m venv venv' then 'source venv/bin/activate')
* Be sure to 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to ensure you have all the correct dependencies. But only after you have a virtual environment.
