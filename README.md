This is a project inspired by Patrick Bacon's TopDownHockey Scraper project where he predicts NHL success based off AHL success. I predicted NHL success based off NCAA success. 

Some tips to make sure your file runs correctly when you clone this down:
-First create a virtual environment. (I like to do 'python -m venv venv' then 'source venv/bin/activate')
-Be sure to 'pip install -r requirements.txt' to ensure you have all the correct dependencies. But only after you have a virtual environment.
